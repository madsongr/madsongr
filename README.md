- 👋 Hi, I’m @madsongr

- 👀 I’m interested in web/mobile development, including websites, web and mobile applications.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning React JS and React Native with Expo and Node.js. 
I'm a developer since 2014 also working with PHP, MySQL and the basics of web development (HTML, CSS and Javascript).
I've created some web platforms for my clients also using Vue.js.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on React/React Native projects.
